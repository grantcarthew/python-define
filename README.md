# define

An OpenAI-powered command-line linguistics assistant.

If you're like me, you often feel unsure about the spelling of words, and sometimes even the definition of a word. Perhaps you're a programmer trying to come up with a name for that variable, function, data, or whatever else.

The 'define' command is a godsend. It's one of the best things to come out of Large Language Models.

It uses the OpenAI API to query definitions of words, correct spelling mistakes, and provide synonyms as well as antonyms.

The 'define' command solely utilizes ChatGPT v3.5 and will cost you around $1 USD per month for typical use.
